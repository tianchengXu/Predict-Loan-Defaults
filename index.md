## Role & Main Tasks in the Project





## Business Understanding
According to information presented by the World Bank, the percentage of nonperforming loans to total gross loans in India has been rising dramatically since 2011. Currently, 7.39% of the total gross loans were nonperforming loans, which is about 200% higher than the level in 2011. Defaulting on a personal loan is generally considered as a civil dispute in India. Once an individual defaults on their loan, banks will have to hand them over to professional recovery agents. Eventually the banks will need to resort to either a “Hair Cut” or the SARFAESI Act to recovery at least part of the loan, a time- and money-consuming process.

To minimize the chance of customers defaulting on their loans, commercial banks require applicants to go through a very detailed screening process. During the process, banks want to improve their ability in identifying individuals with higher risks of defaulting on loans. Once identified, these individuals can be passed on to further scrutiny/analysis. Our motivation for the project comes mainly from the belief that more accurately estimating defaults can considerably increase the profitability of banks.

Banks or financial institutions with more powerful data mining techniques and forecasting models will have an advantage in being able to identify the probability that a client defaults, then charge rates and fees or turn down loan applications more accurately (to different customers), thus maximizing profits while lowering risks. According to Stein's research work on the relationship between default prediction and lending profits, a bank can increase its profitability by around 11 basis points (BPS) for every dollar, which translates into a possible 0.11% increase in the income for every dollar in loans. According to Standard & Poors the market size for housing loans in India is 280 billions of dollars. Therefore, there can be a significant increase in the profitability of the business.
